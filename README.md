Collision system that uses bit shifting for grid based 2D collision
 - This build is currently outdated as of GMS2.3+ 
A newer version would use the new constructors, vec2 and dot products in the GMS update.
There is a tutorial on how to build this on my website @ mackhomann.com
You can follow that blog post as it shows the ideas behind this projectthat can be adjusted to use the new updates from gamemaker
